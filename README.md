## Development

### Pre-commit hooks
Pre-commit hooks are automatically added for unix users via the `addPreCommitHooks` gradle task.
**Note**: In order to successfully execute the pre-defined hooks you must have the `smithy` CLI installed. 
See [installation instructions](https://smithy.io/2.0/guides/smithy-cli/cli_installation.html) if you do not already have the CLI installed.
