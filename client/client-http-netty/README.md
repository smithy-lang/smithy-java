# Smithy Java Client Netty HTTP Transport

This module provides a Netty-based HTTP transport implementation for
Smithy Java clients, offering better resource utilization and async
capabilities compared to the standard Java HttpClient.

[!WARNING] This client is not a work in progress and not recommended for any using other than testing.
